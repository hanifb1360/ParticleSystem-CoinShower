## Coin Shower Effect: Solution Rationale

In my modified version, I implemented a coin shower effect by spawning multiple particles over time. Here are the key changes and reasoning:

- **Spawn Duration:** Coins are spawned over **1000ms** (`this.spawnDuration = 1000`).
- **Particle Lifespan:** Each coin lives for **2000ms** (`this.particleLifespan = 2000`).
- **Total Effect Duration:** The effect lasts **3000ms** (`1000 + 2000`).

> This ensures that the last coin spawned has its full lifespan to animate.  
> If the duration were only 500ms, most coins wouldnâ€™t appear or finish animating.
